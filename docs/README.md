# Lexicon documentation

This directory is the authoritative documentation set for the Lexicon application, architecture, operations, development workflow, and validation evidence.

## Documentation rules

Lexicon documentation follows these rules:

- describe implemented behavior as present tense;
- label dated measurements and validation records with their execution date;
- separate current guarantees from limitations and future possibilities;
- keep command and flag references synchronized with `internal/cli`;
- keep storage and exchange-format claims synchronized with `spec/` and `internal/objectstore`;
- state ownership boundaries explicitly instead of using broad subsystem descriptions;
- link to the owning document rather than duplicating detailed rules across files;
- treat generated evaluation artifacts as evidence, not hand-maintained documentation;
- update affected documentation in the same change as behavior or contract changes.

## Placement rules

Place application behavior, operational procedures, architecture, development workflow, and current status in `docs/`.

Place normative machine-consumed format contracts in `spec/`. Place language-specific extraction details in the corresponding adapter README. Place dated generated results under `evaluation/validation/`; summarize only stable conclusions in documentation.

Do not put speculative product design into current-state documents. A future proposal must be clearly labeled and must not be presented as implemented behavior or an accepted compatibility guarantee.
