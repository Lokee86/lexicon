# Lexicon Rust adapter

This directory contains a self-contained Rust CLI that emits deterministic Lexicon facts v1 JSONL for Cargo repositories and workspaces.

## Usage

From this directory:

```text
cargo run -- --repo /path/to/repository --output /path/to/facts.jsonl
```

The adapter uses `cargo_metadata` for workspace and target discovery and `syn` for source parsing. `--repo` must point to a Cargo package or workspace containing `Cargo.toml`.

The scanner excludes Git/worktree metadata, generated output, dependency trees, caches, and all Warlock tool-state directories.

## Analysis model

Adapter version 0.3.0 emits:

- repository, directory, file, crate/module, type, trait, function, method, import, and macro facts;
- inline and external module ownership;
- local imports, grouped imports, aliases, globs, and re-export bindings when their targets are statically unique;
- inherent and trait implementation relationships;
- `extends`-equivalent implementation ownership through `implements`, plus `overrides` from trait implementation methods to trait contract methods;
- free-function, associated-function, method, constructor-like, UFCS, and local macro call edges;
- receiver and return-value propagation through bindings, fields, parameters, and local expressions;
- callable propagation through function values, closures, callback parameters, tuples, and fields;
- definite `calls` edges and conservative `possible-calls` edges for generic or multi-target trait dispatch;
- explicit builtin, external, dynamic, missing, ambiguous, and unsupported classifications where a definite local target cannot be proven.

Canonical identities are based on Cargo package/target/module-qualified names and normalized repository-relative paths. Absolute checkout paths are never used in node identities or emitted paths.

Trait declarations are contracts and are never emitted as runtime call targets. A single proven concrete implementation emits `calls`; multiple concrete implementations or unconstrained generic/trait-object candidates emit `possible-calls`. Inherited/default trait methods resolve only through indexed repository-local implementations.

## Conservative boundaries

The adapter performs static analysis only. It does not expand procedural macros, execute build scripts, infer runtime plugin registration, or guess targets created through unsafe pointer manipulation, reflection-like registries, or unconstrained dynamic dispatch.

External crates remain `external-target` unless their source is part of the scanned workspace. Macro-generated declarations that are not visible to `syn` cannot be indexed directly.
Dynamic dispatch remains unresolved for procedural-macro-generated methods, build-script registration, reflection-like registries, unconstrained runtime trait objects, unsafe pointer mutation, and other runtime-generated implementations.

## Verification

```text
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

The semantic fixture suite covers declarations, imports, traits, inherent methods, field aliases, constructor-like calls, UFCS, local macros, callbacks, generic trait dispatch, canonical ordering, relative paths, unresolved classifications, and byte-identical repeat runs.
