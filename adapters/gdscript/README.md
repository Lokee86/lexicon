# Lexicon GDScript adapter

This directory contains Lexicon's deterministic GDScript semantic adapter. It scans `.gd` source files and emits Lexicon facts v1 JSONL.

## Usage

```sh
go run . --repo /path/to/project --output /path/to/facts.jsonl
```

The repository may be a Godot project root or any directory containing GDScript. `--output -` writes JSONL to stdout.

## Output contract

The first JSONL record is the v1 header. Subsequent records use the contract's node, edge, and unresolved ordering. Object keys are emitted by Go's sorted JSON map encoding.

The adapter emits:

- repositories, directories, files, and script modules;
- `class_name` and inner class types;
- functions, anonymous functions, signals, constants, and variables;
- lexical `contains` and `defines` relationships;
- `preload()` and `load()` import/reference facts;
- local and path-based inheritance;
- definite `calls` relationships;
- conservative `possible-calls` relationships for ambiguous dispatch and callbacks;
- explicit unresolved classifications for builtin, external, dynamic, missing, and ambiguous targets.

## Static call resolution

Version 0.3 resolves statically defensible repository-local calls through:

- same-script functions and methods;
- correctly owned inner-class and anonymous-function scopes;
- `self` and `super` dispatch;
- local inheritance and method overriding;
- class constructors and static methods;
- literal `preload()` and `load()` aliases, including nested types, type-alias constants, inheritance through preload aliases, and direct construction;
- `res://` paths scoped to the nearest enclosing `project.godot`, including repositories containing multiple Godot projects;
- explicitly typed parameters, locals, members, and return values;
- constructor assignment flow such as `service = Service.new()`;
- untyped assignment flow through resolved parameters;
- argument propagation between resolved callers and callees;
- factory return propagation and chained calls;
- member/property flow when the receiver type is known;
- project-scoped autoload singletons declared in each `project.godot`, with file-local preload aliases taking lexical precedence;
- `Callable(receiver, "method")`, callable assignments, parameters, properties, and returns;
- literal callback dictionaries and `Dictionary.get()` callback lookup;
- common callback arguments such as `signal.connect(handler)` and `values.map(handler)`;
- literal dynamic invocation names used by `call`, `call_deferred`, `rpc`, and `rpc_id`.

The type-flow analysis is a bounded deterministic fixed point. It combines only concrete local evidence; it does not execute code or guess runtime types.

Typed base receivers include repository-local descendant overrides as `possible-calls`; exact constructed receivers narrow to one method and emit `calls`. `extends` and `overrides` are emitted for script inheritance. Engine classes and scripts are not treated as fabricated local contracts, and interface-like behavior without explicit static type evidence remains unresolved.

## Conservative boundaries

GDScript and Godot permit substantial runtime behavior. The adapter intentionally leaves these unresolved rather than inventing graph edges:

- values whose type never becomes statically recoverable;
- computed method names and reflective dispatch;
- scene-tree node types inferred only from `.tscn` structure;
- runtime script replacement and dynamically generated resources;
- computed preload/load paths;
- engine methods, engine classes, and external addons outside the scanned source set;
- external or computed autoload targets;
- signal connections or callbacks whose callable target is computed dynamically.
- runtime method replacement, scene-instantiated polymorphism without a typed receiver, and computed `call`/`call_deferred`/RPC method names.

Builtin and engine-owned calls are classified separately from missing repository-local targets. Multiple defensible local targets become `possible-calls` rather than an arbitrary definite edge.

## Canonical identities

All node IDs are `sha256:` digests of:

```text
lexicon:v1\0gdscript\0<kind>\0<canonical identity>
```

Canonical identities use:

- `repository`: repository directory basename;
- `directory`: normalized relative directory path, with `.` for the root;
- `file`: normalized relative `.gd` path;
- `module`: normalized relative `.gd` path;
- declarations: source path plus lexical declaration path and name, with deterministic source-order ordinals for duplicates;
- `import`: source path, source-order ordinal, and normalized loader expression.

File `content_id` is the SHA-256 digest of the original file bytes. Absolute checkout paths never participate in IDs. Records are sorted deterministically, and repeated scans of unchanged input produce byte-identical JSONL.

## Source exclusions

The scanner ignores generated state and dependency/build trees including:

- `.git`, `.worktrees`, and `.workingtrees`;
- Warlock tool-state directories such as `.ddocs`, `.lexicon`, `.arcana`, `.grimoire`, and `.warlock`;
- `.godot`, `.import`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `target`, `build`, `dist`, `bin`, and `obj`;
- common language and test caches.

Only directories on the path to a `.gd` file become directory facts.

## Tests

```sh
go test ./...
```

The suite covers declarations, imports, exclusions, stable IDs, class/static calls, typed receivers, literal load/preload aliases, nested type aliases and preload-based inheritance, nested Godot project roots, scoped autoloads and lexical shadowing, inheritance, `self`/`super`, expression-boundary receiver parsing, inner classes, anonymous functions, constructor and parameter flow, factory returns, callable and callback-map propagation, contract ordering, and repeat-run determinism.
